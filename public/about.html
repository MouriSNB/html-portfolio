<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi this is Mourish Mano Ranjan Baskaran. This is my first webpage I made. Date 24/06/2023 and Time 12.45pm.
   I'm 21 years old, which I'll turn 22 in next two days. Heh. I completed my schooling in Hindusthan Matriculation and Higher Secondary School, Coimbatore. I completed my Bachelor's of ECE in Hindusthan College of Engineering and Technology. 
   I had fun times during my college days. Got bummer mostly. Major heartbreaks. But gradually I'm healing myself from it. And my friends helped me one way or other.
   Carrying a sweet burden of all the memories with. Fortunately I got placed in two companies in placement itself. And waiting for joining in one of the companies.
</p>

<p>Trying hard to make myself some progress so that i could outperform in my training period and get improve myself to grab the job which I had cracked for.
  I'm actually an introvert person, but I do like making friends. Get a connect to a new person. I want to make my life circle big. Maybe later in life I might regret of making a big circle of people.
  Who knows!. And I would proudly say I made some worthy amount of connection with some people, who came to into life by some cause of event. And I'm carrying a honest healthy relationship with them. 
  Even if I don't talk with them very much.
</p>

<p>I don't have many goals or an ambition. I know it is not appreciatable to be like this for most people. Thing is, I do have some kind of dreams more than goals or ambition. And it might feel people who hear like, " This is your dream? LOL!". That is all they feel. But honestly that is how I want to carry on with my life.
  I want to be simple. Enjoy the life. Not to struggle with my problems to achieve in big level. I will make some efforts to profit myself in a good way so that I can live my life as I like.
  After all, who knows who's life gonna end when. Yeah I'm typically weak physically and mentally. I don't have a good physique to show off or attracts girls or even support myself in dangerous situations. Like I'm hopeless and helpless.
  Maybe someday I might surpass my weakness. Not to imagine I would reach greater places be rich anol. I just want to cross my limits and not to go further. Just as it is.
</p>

<p> And yeah that's all about me. Nothing more to say.</p>
